When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To access it from other computers, for working together with other programmers, for asking for help from the community. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If automatically pulled from GitHub you may be updating your local with changes from other collaborators that you are not ready to merge into your code. Conflicts can happen when pulling and pushing data so it is best to control the times when you will be updating both remote and local.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork creates that repo into your GitHub account, clone can be made from GitHub to local or from local to local. branch adds a new branch to an existing repo. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can fetch that information without merging in order to work offline and decide when to merge the remote and your local version. Pulling gives you the ability to get the state of the remote version that several people may have been working on to your local repository.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Maybe dropbox. Github and git gives you much more flexibility.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Notify everyone and give them the ability to review what I did before actually pushing it into the master branch.
