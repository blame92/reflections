How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    As files get bigger it will be easier

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Lets you get control of your versions without having too small versions that add no value. Cons would be that you have to manually commit and is prone to manual error

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    With the user in mind

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Log will let you see the commit history. You can see more stats using â€”stat. diff can tell you the difference between 2 commits (previous version is always shown below).

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always revert back and not ruin the project.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
